 Soon, do I wonder what keeps you up at night around this issue of AI? The urgency to work and deploy it in a beneficial way. But at the same time, it can be very harmful if deployed wrongly. And we don't have all the ancestry at the technologies moving fast. So does that keep me up at night? Absolutely. Can you keep up with that speed of innovation and make sure it remains on if you will a human scale? I think one of the things we need to be careful when it comes to AI is avoid what I would call race conditions where people working on it across companies, etc. So get caught up in whose first that we lose the potential pitfalls and downsides to it. You are going slowly in terms of rolling out barred. I wonder if you think open AI and Microsoft acted irresponsibly. I will open AI speak about this and I think there are many views. I think one of the points they have made is you don't want to put a technology out like this. It's very, very powerful because it gives society no time to adapt. I think that's reasonable perspective. I think that there are responsible people there trying to figure out how to approach this technology and so are we. Google's motto edits and the section was don't be evil but Sundar Pachai has modified that a little bit, what would you say that Google's values are? It's rooted in our mission. It is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our founders captured it well that don't be evil. We really want to be as helpful as possible to ask many users everywhere. The goal of improving their knowledge, success, health and happiness. That's how I think about our company. Don't be evil is still a driving value of the company? Yes. We have a more nuanced view of it which is like how do you do the right thing and what is the responsibilities that come with it. It's a lot more of a nuanced view but it underpins how we think about things.
